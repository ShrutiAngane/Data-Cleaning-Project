# Data-Cleaning-Project
A project to illustrate data cleaning steps on an untidy dataset.

This project includes the process of data cleaning which is done before giving our dataset to the model for predictive modeling.
The dataset which I have used here for my project is from kaggle. 

Dataset : https://www.kaggle.com/dansbecker/melbourne-housing-snapshot/data 


This dataset includes data regarding Melbourne housing and its prices based on various features.Here the target variable is 'Price' which is supposed to be predicted given the test data but I have only performed the initial step which is cleaning as this project is done to illustrate my knowledge in the same.
